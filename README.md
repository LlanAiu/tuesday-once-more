A web application built on the idea of doing a little bit of review every day.

## Overview
Full disclosure, this is a primarily an exploration so that I can learn more about the Next, React, TS, HTML, CSS, and SQL, seeing as I haven't had much exposure to web development.

In terms of the actual project, it was based on my inability to cram study. Other features, in particualr the (will be weighted, eventually) randomization of problems, were mainly inspired by one of my favorite math competition practice sites - AMCTrivial (amctrivial.com)

How does this work in deployment or production? Dunno; haven't thought about that yet; I'll get there when I get there.
